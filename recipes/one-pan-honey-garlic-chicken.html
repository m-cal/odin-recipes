<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>A delectably baked, perfectly seasoned chicken dish that is sure to make anyone lucky enough to try it ask for seconds.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
  <li>salt, to taste</li>
  <li>pepper, to taste</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup honey</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 lb green beans</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C)</li>
  <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear both sides until golden brown. (The skin side will take much longer, in order to properly render the fat and crisp up the skin.)</li>
  <li>Remove chicken thighs and set aside. Pour out any excess fat, but leave some in for the sauce.</li>
  <li>Add garlic, stir until fragrant, then add brown sugar, honey, thyme, and oregano, and stir. Reduce heat to low.</li>
  <li>Return chicken to the skillet. Coat the chicken in the sauce.</li>
  <li>Add green beans to skillet.</li>
  <li>Bake for 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
